Community & Outreach
====================

Working with a study advisory board
-----------------------------------

*By Rachael Davis*

A study advisory board provides an invaluable community perspective for
research projects. This is achieved by ensuring that the board
members are diverse in terms of their knowledge and expertise.

For example, my study focuses on bilingual children with and without
autism. The board includes an autistic member who is trilingual and
works in education, a parent of an autistic trilingual child, a speech
and language therapist and bilingualism academics and experts.

The board members provide input on refining research questions and
protocols and shaping the study design, participation and dissemination
of findings based on the priorities of the communities they represent.
The diversity of board members ensures that every stage of the project
is aligned with the needs of the community that you are working for and
with.

[Sample documents:]{.underline}

- The first document is an email template inviting individuals to join
the advisory board.

- The second document is a terms of reference sample that we used with
our advisory board. Terms of reference are a set of rules that define
the purpose and structures of the board. It ensures all members
understand how each meeting will work and the expectations for board
members. This should be discussed and agreed upon in the first board
meeting.

- The third is a sample of working practises -- this refers to general
rules for how each meeting will work for the board members -- for
example, the frequency of meetings and what is expected from each
member. It is important to have your working practise discussion points
for your first meeting.

- The final document is an example of a voting system that we used for
making decisions within the group. It's an inclusive, quick and easy
voting system that ensures that everyone is getting a say in the
decision making process.

Open access: Getting your papers made available to everyone
-----------------------------------------------------------

*By Sue FW*

Our Centre has a dedicated office who will take newly-accepted papers
and make sure a copy is posted up online for anyone to access. Simply
email <ccbs-openaccess@ed.ac.uk> with your acceptance email from the
journal.

    -  Make sure that the email contains the date of acceptance

    -  Attach the final version of the manuscript that you submitted --
       this should have author details (i.e. include the title page in the
       document) but should not have any journal formatting. It needs to be
       YOUR copy.

    -  Make sure the manuscript includes acknowledgements for any funding
       that supported the work

    -  Add a note if you think the research deserves media attention -- if
       so, summarise the finding and the implications

Poster printing
---------------

*Catherine Crompton*

Teviot Print Shop (based in the entrance hallway of Teviot Student
Union) do very reasonable poster printing, with fairly quick turnaround.
If you want a cheap fabric poster so you don't have to wrestle a poster
tube on to the plane, they charge for £35 for an A0 fabric poster.
