\**obviously, these terms are OK for a clear 'disease' such as epilepsy
or dementia*

Notes on language:

    - Imagine reading your text out loud to an autistic colleague at the
      University -- would you feel comfortable?

    - There are big differences of opinion between disabled people and no
      form of language is universally preferred

    - When speaking with an individual, or writing / talking about them
      (with their permission) you should always ask about their preferred
      language form and use this.

    - Person first (e.g. person with autism) was historically preferred
      and came out of an early disability rights movement -- the goal is
      to put the person first, before the disability. Many parents of
      younger children and practitioners may expect this form of language.

    - However, identity-first language (autistic person) is now very
      popular and increasing in popularity, especially among
      neurodivergent people themselves
